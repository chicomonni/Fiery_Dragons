## Info on the executable:
- The executable can be run on a mac device and created on VSCode using the file
at /src/Main.java as the main class.
- The players are illustrated as numbers on the gameboard.

## Info on the video (or lack thereof)
- The video was not created due to mental health reasons (sorry)
- I'll still explain what I did to hopefully make it easier to mark the rest of
the assignment :')
- The main class runs the game and immediately starts at a position where player
1 has turned over all but one cards. Once the player turns over the last card,
the game moves to player 2 as indicated by the text just above the textfield at
the bottom of the screen. This player is able to select any card, and if they
select an animal card that is different to the cave they are on, it moves to
the next player. Alternatively if a player chooses to skip the remainder of their
turn by entering 'X' the game moves to the next player.
